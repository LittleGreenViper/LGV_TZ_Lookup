/**
    This class is basically a struct, containing one entity.

    The entity is usually one multipolygon segment, as defined in the main data file. It may represent the entirety of a timezone,
    but is more likely to be just one part.
    
    It has a timezone ID, a detailed list of polygon points, and a "domain rect," which is a simple rect that encompasses all of the points.
    We use the domain rect to quickly triage comparisons, and find out where they apply, before applying a more expensive algorithm to do a more
    exact polygon match.
